PROJECT ANALYSIS
Overall, with the drug Capomulin we saw an observable reduction on tumor volume, and significantly more mice survived over the course of the 45 day clinical trial.
On the contrary, the drug Ketapril showed the least effect on tumor volume, with an actual increase overall compared to the neutral treatment (placebo), showing a clear association.
With Infubinol, more mice died overall during the course of the study, however when compared to Ketapril it showed less tumor growth and metastic site count. This infers that another factor must be in play, as size and site count do not neccisarily correlate to the most deaths.
